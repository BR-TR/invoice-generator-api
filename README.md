# Invoice Generator API
For those times when you just need an invoice

## About

We created a simple API at Invoiced to generate invoice PDFs on the fly. This service has been used internally by us for some time. We believe this could be useful for other projects as well.

The API only has a single endpoint that returns a PDF. We don't store any of your invoice data.

### Endpoint

``https://invoice-generator.com``

### Rate Limiting

The API is rate limited, however, it should be sufficient for a reasonable amount of testing and use. If you plan to use this in production let's talk at hello@invoiced.com.

## Sample Projects using API

- Go: generate invoices programatically
- Ruby: generate invoices from Stripe webhooks

## Examples
